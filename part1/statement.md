# Working with text

In this activity, we will be working with text values. In JavaScript, text values are stored in a String Data Type.

**Learn more about the String Data Type [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings)**

Strings are declared using the " ' or `respectively.

For example, to create a String variable called name, we use the following code:

```javascript
let name = "John";
```

or to declare a String constant called country, we use the following code:

```javascript
const country = "Germany";
```

Now, for our caesar cipher decryption program, we will need to store our message and all the letters in our alphabet as Strings. In the code below, create a variable called `message` and set it to _hello_ and a constant called `ALPHABET` (note the capitals!) set it to _abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_
